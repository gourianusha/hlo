The small streams of River Godavari are the source of this waterfall, and these streams gradually breaks away as they flow over the Sahyadri Mountain Range.[1] The Pochera waterfall has an emerald, green colored tinge, due to the granite rock bed.[how?] Situated amidst dense forests, this waterfall is a popular tourist attraction in Telangana and India.[citation needed]
